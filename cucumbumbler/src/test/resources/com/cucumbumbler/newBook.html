To Bumble your Cucumber means you want to manage Cucumber to provide full application
life cycle Specifications, including the aggregation of them, to specify all aspects of
the system, for example, in all the testing quadrants, including: 
  manual testing, functional, non-functional and integration with static code analysis</H3><p>Background</p><H2>What are Cucumber Feature Files?</H2><pre>Given </pre><pre>a team is using 'specification by example'<pre><pre>When </pre><pre>they apply it regularly in their test-first practices<pre><pre>Then </pre><pre>a very powerful single source-of-truth emerges that is both a specification and automated behavior verification<pre><H3>I use Cucumber features to create a living system "book"</H3><div>    	In order to create a single source-of-truth about my product

 	I'd like to organize a single source-of-truth in a "book" format using executable specifications
