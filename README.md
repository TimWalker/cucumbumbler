# cucumbumbler

To Cucumbumble means to Bumble your Cucumber files. 

To Bumble your Cucumber means you want to manage Cucumber to provide full application life cycle Specifications, including the aggregation of them, to specify all aspects of the system, for example, in all the testing quadrants, including: manual testing, functional, non-functional and integration with static code analysis

Cucumbumbler wraps and combines your Cucumber feature files, as well information in other forms, in a way that allows it to "Generate a Book", that is factually backed by live automation and manual testing, and which serves as the primary specification of your system. With Cucumbumbler, the "book" itself can be executed ensuring desired behavior that is always current with the documentation describing it.  

Cucumbumbler can drive manual and exploratory testing from any set of Cucumber features and can store results in traditional testing tools as well. 

Cucumbumbler augments your agile processes in many ways, allowing Specification by Example (Behavior Driven Development, ATDD) to be used to specify all requirements of your system in a single, clear and consistent fashion available to all stakeholders. Truly "The Book of Your System". 

Cucumbumbler allows you organize you Cucumbers (virtually) in a rolled-up, single source of truth, that is always accurate and current as backed by the automated and manual testing required to "back" that state.
